### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chad. I'm a senior data engineer and all things data consultant. I analyze data architectures and technical infrastructure to identify opportunities for improvement and cost-savings. Most of my work is focused on the [Azure Cloud Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), although I have extensive experience working with on-premises data systems as well. I've worked with a wide range of different organizations, from non-profits to Fortune 500 companies, and I'm always excited to learn new ways of managing data.
