### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Chad. I'm a senior data engineer and all things data consultant. I analyze data storage and processing systems and identify opportunities for optimization and cost-savings. Most of my work is focused on the [Azure Cloud Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/), although I have extensive experience working with on-premises data systems as well.
